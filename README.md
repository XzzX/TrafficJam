# Simple Traffic Jam Simulation
A simple car model is used. In every time step each car is doing the following actions.
* accelerate
* break if there is someone right in front
* dawdle with a certain possibility
* move

A sample output can be seen below. The street goes from left to right. From top to bottom you can see the time evolution. Black dots resemble cars, white dots are empty space.
